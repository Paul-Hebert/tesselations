## Perf

- CSS/JS bundling
- Maybe use Vite

## Randomization

- Add curved sides
- Add more randomness to # of points
- Fine tune color generation
- Add rotation
- Add different geometries
- Screen reader/meta description
- Ability to pass in options
- Checkerboard style

## App UI

- Add "starring" tesselations
- Add "similar" section
- Improve focus styles on cards
- Improve details page design
- Add app header
- Improve "hero" section

## Misc

- Linting
 
## Issues

- Sometimes there are transparent sections in designs. I think this is due to the secondary axis going past the other end.
- Sometimes the strokes don't contrast well enough.
- Are complementary colors too intense? Should these be less common? Less saturated? Less bright?
- Using base 64 increases size of background CSS
- Make code synchronous in fetch-or-create-data.js
- Does the way I'm merging the query string leave XSS vulns?
- Switch data storage to database?
