## Randomization

- Add curved sides
- Add complementary color scheme option
- Add more randomness to # of points

## App UI

- Save SVGs
- Add generated names
- Create detail pages
- Add CSS background code
- Add editing controls

## Issues

- Sometimes there are transparent sections in designs. I think this is due to the secondary axis going past the other end.
- Sometimes the stroked don't contrast well enough.
