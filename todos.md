## Randomization

- Add curved sides
- Add more randomness to # of points
- Fine tune color generation
- Add rotation
- Add different geometries
- Screen reader/meta description
- Ability to pass in options

## App UI

- Add CSS background code
- Add editing controls
- Add "starring" tesselations
- Add "similar" section
- Improve focus styles

## Issues

- Sometimes there are transparent sections in designs. I think this is due to the secondary axis going past the other end.
- Sometimes the stroked don't contrast well enough.
- Are complementary colors too intense? Should these be less common? Less saturated? Less bright?
